- Very rare planets types and conditions have been made unique, often with stronger effects. (Artificial, Magnetic and Perpetual Storm planets, Parasitic Spores, Xeno-fungus and Lingering Virus conditions),
- Added "Chemical Crystals" uncommon condition that can show up on toxic worlds to give them *some* colonization value from time to time.
