- Reworked backgrounds: 
   . Now includes 69 backdrops (from 27),
   . They are somewhat more consistent in art-style and darker as to not disrupt gameplay.

- Background list can be expanded through modSettings.json entries with third-party sub-mods,
- All strings have been externalized for ease of translation,
- Very rare planets types and conditions have been made unique, often with stronger effects. (Artificial, Magnetic and Perpetual Storm planets, Parasitic Spores, Xeno-fungus and Lingering Virus conditions),
- Added "Chemical Crystals" uncommon condition that can show up on toxic worlds to give them *some* colonization value from time to time.
