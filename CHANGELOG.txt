TODO
Add a new Dust world variant (maybe)
Add an extra effect to the Artificial world (maybe)
Add Solar clouds (maybe)
Add custom planet art from Illus.Ent to unique worlds (maybe, provided SirHartley agrees)
Update icon for military base
Check if Lifeless and Arid Lifeless are in the correct categories
Rework hab categories like Desertic
Make Jungle worlds a swap as to not inflate the sector with Jungles (and Eccentric has actually decent odds of spawning)
Make Windwsept always have hab/never replace cat_hab1 (you pick)
Fix math random technically always being like 0.01 off (or just switch to a better random) int stars = (int) Math.round(getNormalRandom(1, 7));
Consider placing 0 in the planet data csv for hycean
Consider swappin hyceans to cat toxic (this will nullify the previous point)

TODO extra planets
NOTE: implement the planets as skins first, then implement skin swapping, then given them custom pools
