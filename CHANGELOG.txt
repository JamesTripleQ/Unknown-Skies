TODO
Add the Fluorescent Giant
Add a new Dust world variant (maybe)
Add an extra effect to the Artificial world (maybe)
Add Solar clouds (maybe)
Add custom planet art from Illus.Ent to unique worlds (maybe, provided SirHartley agrees)
Make Artificial worlds always has Ind.Evo ruins (maybe)
Check if Lifeless and Arid Lifeless are in the correct categories
Rework hab categories like Desertic
Make Jungle worlds a swap as to not inflate the sector with Jungles (and Eccentric has actually decent odds of spawning) might not be needed
Swap some icons for military base
Investigate the restoration of new procgen rings

TODO Hycean
Current progress:
Planet spec is done (along with procgen radius and color)

WEIGHTS are not configured and several condition groups are missing

What's next:
Actual proc gen with proper spawn rates
Condition gen
Description
Check if vanilla market images in a special way for Water worlds.
Check how Ind.Evo spawns conditions (depending on the system used to spawn the planet)
