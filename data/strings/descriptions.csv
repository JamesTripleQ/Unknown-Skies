US_acid,PLANET,"Acid worlds are rich in common minerals, with heavy deposits of formic, hydrochloric, hydro-cyanic, nitric, phosphoric, and sulfuric acids. They appear green from space with a green and brown surface.",,,
,,,,,
US_alkali,PLANET,"Alkali worlds are rich in alkali base metals, with medium deposits of strontium, barium, and calcium. They appear green from space, with blotches of teal and blue on the surface. These planets may support some forms of life.",,,
,,,,,
US_artificial,PLANET,"Artificial worlds are actually telluric worlds, the surfaces of which are entirely covered over with artificial structures. Theories abound as to what created them, with the most popular suggesting that they are the product of rogue Domain construction drones abandoned after the Collapse. These drones were left to build and rebuild the entire surface into a maze of concrete until they themselves crumbled into dust.",,,
,,,,,
US_auric,PLANET,"Auric worlds have a massive metallic core, often composed of gold. The extraction of this valuable metal proves difficult to collect due to an auric world's comparatively strong gravitational pull for their size. They appear yellow from space and can support some forms of life.",,,
,,,,,
US_azure,PLANET,"Azure worlds feature light deposits of indium, vanadium, and molybdenum, giving them a characteristic blue tint from space and a heavily cratered surface. These planets rarely possess any atmosphere, and are usually devoid of life and seldom targeted for colonization as a result.",,,
,,,,,`
US_burnt,PLANET,"Burnt worlds are telluric bodies orbiting older stars on very stable orbits. Subjected to billions of years of heat and radiation, they are utterly lifeless and uninhabitable. The degenerating isotopes composing their crust also render them unsuitable for sustained exploitation.",,,
,,,,,
US_red,PLANET,"A deathly dry world with an ominous red crust. The surface displays a warm hue from oxidized iron compounds and a high concentration of heavy carbides. A thin atmosphere prevails, with the predominant carbon dioxide occasionally stirred into planet-wide dust storms. Icecaps of atmospheric CO2 may form and sublime with the turn of the seasons.",,,
,,,,,
US_green,PLANET,"The stunning green surface of these planets derives its tint from the high concentration of pure chlorine and hydrochloric acids, making it toxic to all known life. Additionally, volatile emanations from the exposed surface create a runaway greenhouse effect, elevating surface temperature and atmospheric pressures to extremely high levels.",,,
,,,,,
US_purple,PLANET,"A frozen world of liquid methane. The surface is extremely cold, but it is viable for humans with proper precautions. Carbon dioxide may freeze out of the atmosphere at the poles during the winter. Limited biospheres have sometimes been observed deep under the ocean's surface, but such life-forms cannot be exploited in any useful way except as subjects for xenobiology studies.",,,
,,,,,
US_crimson,PLANET,"An arid world with an extremely thin atmosphere, rendering the surface susceptible to asteroid bombardment. Nevertheless, its substantial mass enables it to retain some water brought by the constant barrage, and a magnetic field shields the surface from stellar radiation, allowing a limited biosphere to slowly establish an existence here.",,,
,,,,,
US_arid,PLANET,"This planet presents a stark dichotomy between vast oceans and bone-dry deserts swirling with dust. Abnormal tectonic movements appear to have prevented the proper formation of a planetary crust, leading to the creation of a deep, fractal maze of canyons and chasms that restrict the presence of water reserves on most of the surface. Despite this, the rare oceans are often teeming with cellular life.",,,
,,,,,
US_dust,PLANET,"This ancient world is as dry as bone and continually shrouded by dust storms. High plateaus indicate the presence of former continents on a world that used to be covered with liquid water, dissipated over the eons due to a weakening magnetic field. Now, stellar radiation mercilessly bombards the surface.",,,
,,,,,
US_continent,PLANET,"A single landmass dominates this world, with two polar oceans surrounding it. With water in abundance and a thick atmosphere, this planet would be a top colonization candidate were it not for the extreme climate of freezing winters and blistering summers, making local food production problematic at best. Still, a hardy biosphere of bacteria, lichen, and insects survives on the planet's surface.",,,
,,,,,
US_lifeless,PLANET,"A planet with a full water cycle that never hosted any form of life. A perfect target for colonization, as the lack of any previous biosphere means no competition for an imported one.",,,
,,,,,
US_magnetic,PLANET,"Shielded from radiation due to their exceptionally strong magnetic field, these planets are often home to some form of life or are at least habitable to a degree. The planet possesses a distinct topology, created by unique weather patterns and iron-rich surface water thanks to the strong magnetic field.",,,
,,,,,
US_storm,PLANET,"A planet that has been gradually shaped into a smooth sphere by relentless, strong winds carrying dense clouds of grit and other abrasive materials. Although habitable, the surface conditions are harsh due to constant equipment wear and the risk of being struck by rogue storm-tossed objects. This makes colonies on them easily defensible, albeit at an ongoing cost.",,,
,,,,,
US_archipelago,PLANET,"A telluric planet entirely covered by liquid water, with a few active volcanoes dotting the surface of its world ocean. The biosphere here is rich and relentless, thanks to the rapid surface CO2 cycle and stable depths. However, the idyllic setting can be somewhat spoiled for prospecting colonists by the occasional giant predator attack.",,,
