Magnetic Crust,US_magnetic,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_magnetic,"$market's crust is rich in magnesite with a dense iron core, resulting in an exceptionally strong magnetic field. While shielding the surface from harmful radiation, it hinders colonization efforts by necessitating heavy protection for all electronic components. This intense magnetism, though challenging for settlers, provides a significant advantage to defenders during an invasion, as radio communications are naturally scrambled, unlike hardened land-lines.",graphics/icons/markets/US_magnetic.png,10
Chaotic Structures,US_artificial,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_artificial,"$market is blanketed by an Escherian maze of abandoned buildings, incomplete tunnels, sporadic roads, and assorted structures. Counterintuitively, this architectural chaos doesn't support the establishment or growth of colonies, lacking a coherent city plan. However, the landscape offers exceptional defensibility against invaders without a precise 3D scan, as the myriad paths mostly lead to nowhere through both open and hidden passages.",graphics/icons/markets/US_artificial.png,10
Perpetual Dust Storm,US_storm,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_storm,"$market is shrouded in a perpetual dust storm, intensifying material wear and compelling settlements to exist underground. The challenging landing conditions dampen commerce, but they equally disadvantage invaders, placing them at odds against well-entrenched defenses hidden in the dust.",graphics/icons/markets/dust_storm.png,10

Military Virus,US_virus,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_virus,"$market would be a desirable locale if not for a lingering military virus deployed in some long-forgotten conflict. While native wildlife remains unaffected, human inhabitants must take extreme precautions to survive. The virus lies dormant in various materials, making entrenched defenses impossible, as any damage to such structures poses a major infection risk. This constant threat deters population growth, resulting in a significantly reduced immigration rate. However, it creates an ideal location for constructing a bio-weapon production facility.",graphics/icons/markets/xenoplague.png,10
Parasitic Spores,US_mind,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_mind,"$market seems to be home to a very peculiar plant, one whose spores can influence mammalian cognitive processes. Affected individuals present a heightened sense of empathy, as well as a flourishing libido. Sadly, the spores also affect the motor-control centers of the brain, shortening the affected subject's attention span and reducing their ability to complete precise or complex tasks.",graphics/icons/markets/US_mind.png,10
Psychoactive Fungus,US_shrooms,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_shrooms,"Among the native lifeforms of $market, a species of fungi has been identified as having strong psychoactive properties. While most people have obvious reservations about consuming an alien organism that alters cognitive processes, a small subset of the sector's population is ready to buy these fungi for a hefty sum. The often-violent activities caused by illegal and shady sellers of the fungus impact the stability of the colony greatly.",graphics/icons/markets/US_fungus.png,10

Pre-Collapse Military Base,US_base,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_base,"$market was a significant military center before the Collapse. Though long abandoned and unusable, some of the documentation and tools survived. This can aid in refining production protocols, resulting in a significant improvement in the quality of locally-built ships.",graphics/icons/markets/arms_tradeshow.png,10

Ancient Religious Landmark,US_religious,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_religious,"$market was a significant religious destination for pilgrims before the Collapse. Some sites still stand today, and their rediscovery is likely to attract a flock of immigrants and enhance local commerce.",graphics/icons/markets/US_religious.png,10
Floating Continent,US_floating,TRUE,,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.econ.BaseHazardCondition,"Vast structures were built in $market's upper atmosphere before the Collapse, providing much-needed landmass for colonization. While most of the buildings upon them have been irreparably damaged by time, winds, and storms, the platforms themselves were built to last and can still be used today.",graphics/icons/markets/US_floating.png,10
Crashed Terraforming Drone,US_crash,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_crash,"While most of $market has an extremely harsh environment, a crashed terraforming drone has managed to maintain a habitable oasis around itself. However, the habitable area is limited and will not extend far enough for a large colony, should one be established on this planet.",graphics/icons/markets/US_crash.png,10
Old Space Accelerator,US_elevator,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_elevator,"$market is home to a space accelerator, offering a cost-effective means to reach low planetary orbit. Although they demand more infrastructure work than spaceports and are not as adept at handling substantial freight, they can be situated much closer to a settlement, enhancing local commerce.",graphics/icons/markets/US_accelerator.png,10
Underground Network,US_tunnels,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_tunnels,"$market has been exploited by mining drones in the past, resulting in a vast network of crisscrossing tunnels that extend deep inside its crust. While the risk of tunnel collapse is ever-present in the volatile regions closer to the planet's core, surface tunnels can be easily sealed, providing a protective barrier for a colony against environmental hazards.",graphics/icons/markets/US_tunnels.png,10
Accessible Sub-Ice Bedrock,US_bedrock,TRUE,,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.econ.BaseHazardCondition,"Some areas of $market have a stable ice sheet thin enough to allow digging down to the actual bedrock of the planet. This enables the establishment of underground colonies that can access vast deposits of groundwater or use geothermal power plants to generate energy, with the mantle of ice above shielding them from harm.",graphics/icons/markets/US_bedrock.png,10

Chemical Crystals,US_crystals,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_crystals,"The extreme conditions on $market allowed for the growth of sprawling crystalline structures. Gullible bourgeoisie and collectors will pay a high price for pieces of these fascinating spectacles.",graphics/icons/markets/US_crystals.png,10
